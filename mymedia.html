    My Favourite book is Mahabharat. 
    The story mentions the battle of both the families in a place called Kurukshetra, which is situated in north Delhi, Haryana. 
    It mentions the birth of Lord Vishnu in a human form named Krishna, who led the Pandavas t their victory. 
    It seems to have a huge influnce over the Indian people as they consider it a holy text that talks about important figures in history.

    My Favourite movie is Raazi
    "Raazi" is a gripping thriller about Indian espionage that follows the terrifying journey of Sehmat, an Indian agent who married into a Pakistani household in 1971.
    In a striking performance, Alia Bhatt captures Sehmat's deep struggle between duty and passion.
    The film, which was directed by Meghna Gulzar, is praised for its deep examination of patriotism and subtle storytelling.
